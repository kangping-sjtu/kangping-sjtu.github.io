      <p>I am currently an Assistant Professor with the College of Smart Energy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.<br><br>
          
     I received my B.Sc. degree and Ph.D degree both in Electrical Engineering from North China Electric Power University, in 2015 and 2020, respectively, supervised by Prof. <a  href="https://ee.ncepu.edu.cn/szdw/dzjys/zgzc5/wf/index.htm">Fei Wang</a> and Prof.  <a  href=" https://laps.ncepu.edu.cn/jgdw/sysyjry/mzq.htm">Zengqiang Mi</a>. From Dec. 2019 to May 2020, I was a visiting student at the University of Salerno, supervised by Prof. <a  href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bSvAqDUAAAAJ&hl=en">Pierluigi Siano</a> . From Jul. 2020 to Jun. 2022, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof.<a  href="https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculties/ningzhang.htm"> Ning Zhang</a>  and Prof. <a  href="https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/faculties/cqkang.htm">Chongqing Kang</a>. <br><br>
          
        I currently serve as the secretary of CIGRE C1.47 Working Group “Energy Sectors Integration and impact on power grids” and IEEE PES (China)-Integrated Energy System Operation and Planning subcommittee. I also serve as the Associate Editor of Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems (PCMP).<br><br>
          
        My research interests include demand response, electricity market, energy forecasting (wind/solar/load/price), and machine learning methods in power systems.<br><br>
        If you are interested to apply the Ph.D. (from spring 2023) /Master (from fall 2022) position in my group, please send me an email with your CV, transcript, and publications. Undergraduate students are also welcome if you are interested in my research. </p>
